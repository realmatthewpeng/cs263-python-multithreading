# Potential TODO Work

- [ ] Gradually increase the number of threads for a multithreaded program (matmul)
- [ ] Test memory safety (access a shared counter and measure error rate)
- [ ] Compare multithreading between GIL and non-GIL versions
- [ ] Compare performance with multiprocessing instead
- [ ] CPU-bound programs and I/O-bound programs
