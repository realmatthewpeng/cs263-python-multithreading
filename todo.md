# Potential TODO Work

- [x] Gradually increase the number of threads for a multithreaded program (fibonacci)
- [x] Test memory safety (access a shared counter and measure error rate)
- [ ] Compare different locking mechanisms to support memory safety
- [x] Compare multithreading between GIL and non-GIL versions
- [ ] Compare performance with multiprocessing instead
- [x] CPU-bound programs and I/O-bound programs
- [ ] Run some tests from <https://openbenchmarking.org/tests>
  - [ ] <https://pyperformance.readthedocs.io/index.html>
  - [ ] <https://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Tools/pybench/>
- [ ] Compare 3.13t with GIL enabled and disabled
- [ ] Measure overhead cost of creating many threads
